# NFLGroupProjectSpring2021
This group project was created by Samuel Peterson and Logan O'Brien for Stat340 at UW-Madison, Spring 2021.

It aimed to perform basic analysis on the offenses of the NFC North to determine which factors seemed to 
indicate "success" for each team.

As you can see, a large portion of this project was the data cleanup required in order to perform our analysis.
Please check out the code and analysis, where further explanation of our project is found.
